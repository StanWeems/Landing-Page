        <h1> Rap, R&B and the Black Experience </h1>
        <p> Whether listening to the politically charged lyrics of Chuck D, the street-hardened rhymes of Missy Elliott, the modern 808s and boastful schemes of Kanye West, or the soulful tones of Whitney Houston they all have two things in common. Unmistakable talent and an affinity for sharing their take on what it is to be a black person in America. </p>

          <p>As a Founding member of Public Enemy, Chuck D was at the foreront of political inspired rap music. He often spoke of the effects of government corruption and brutality on the black community. </p>

          <p> Despite recent actions and criticism, Kanye West pioneered a style of rap music with a heavy focus on production and showing the youth that you don't always have to rap about street life and outward struggles. It's okay to be a black man who likes art, clothes, and design and rap about that.</p>

          <img src="images/missy.jpg" width="200" height="150">
          <p> As one of the most popular hip hop acts of the 90's and early 2000's, she helped show the world that black women were not only capable of making it in the genre but were powerhouses of rap music. In my humble opinion, Missy was and still is going bar for bar with any of your favorite rappers. </p>

          <img src="images/whitney.jpg" width="200" heighth="150">
          <p> Whitney, like many other black artists, started out in the church with Gospel music. This all too common beginning blossomed into her becoming one of the best-selling artists of all time and defining what it meant to be a powerful voice. </p>
